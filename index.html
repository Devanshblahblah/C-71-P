      The food options and responsibilities to consider , canteens must be better organised and more 
      efficient than they have been in the past . Online menus with photographs of the meal prepared , and 
      detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents to make the right nutritional
      choices . Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen
      Account on the school website which keeps track of their previous meal choices and dietiary 
      requirements they may have . Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online eliminates 
      all fuss of money handling , making it safer for students and staff alike . Here again , diversity
      is key .

      Implemented Online Attendance Management System :  This informs parents what their child's / childrens 
      activities , instantly . Once a student reaches the school , the parents will be informed via text 
      messages . This helps schools keep a record of the students' absenteeism . Students can mark the 
      attendance by logging in , and this is stored in a data base , which can be later checked by the Admin .
       The tracker has so much potential that it can identify which students are irregular to their classes 
       and not able to establish connectivity with the actual concepts of their curriculms' subjects . As 
       soon as you enter a student's Enrollment Number or Name , details like availability in class , number 
       of lectures attended will be displayed and no proxies are available since the tracker is supported by 
       cloud capabilities . Even the security is so robust and powerful that those students who always fool 
       their deans are caught in a shorter span - just after admin enters login details into this tracker . 
       All this will increase accuracy and transperancy in any of the educational institutions as students 
       and their parents are pre - informed about the real - time status of leave requests and absenteeism 
       in a confidential manner and at reduced costs .
